                            <p>Facilities often require regular monitoring of their most important buildings. </p> 
                            <p>This monitoring is often performed by patrol groups that check each
                                section and report their action with the use of probes. These probes log datetime and location data (e.g. location X was successfully  checked at datetime Y). 
                            </p>

                                <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/526976751" width="640" height="512" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            </span>
                            
                           

                            <p>
                         
                            This probe data is stored in files (e.g. monday_patrol_data.pdf) so that it can be monitored by stakeholders that care about the correct monitoring of the facility.
                            </p> 
                            <p> The problem is that it is very time consuming to effectively perform this monitoring by checking each log one by one, especially when the facility has many important 
                                sections.
                            
                            For this reason, I developed a Windows application that makes the monitoring extremely easy by analysing the patrol data and providing the user with 
                            insighful visualizations that describe how well the security patrols were performed.
                            </p>
                            <p> I deployed the application at a local facility that makes use of probe data and the results were extremely positive. The first demo shows how the 
                                application works for an imaginary facility with 20 important sections.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            We can make the Patrol Monitoring even better by adjusting the Patrol Settings. We specify different shifts that perform the patrol routes. Each shift is associated
							 with a different color so that we can distinguish them with ease. The application automatically groups the patrol data by shift and shows each shift's performance
							  in the bottom right of the window.
                        </p>
						<p>
                            The second demo shows how the application works for the same facility by splitting the patrol routes into 7 shifts.
                        </p>
