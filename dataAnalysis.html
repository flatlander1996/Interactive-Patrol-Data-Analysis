                                With the Data Analysis page, you can get valueable insights on your patrol routes for any time period you wish. The application analyzes the patrol data 
                                for the selected time frame and provides interactive visualizations.
                            </p>

                                <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/527458969" width="640" height="512" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            </span>

                               The bar chart on the top shows the number of times that each location has been logged in your specified time frame. The data is ordered by number of logs so it is very easy
                                to see which locations are beeing neglected by your patrols.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By clicking on a location, the application shows a time series of the performance of your patrols, relative to that specific location. You can easily
                                 spot the days in which this location was not adequately checked by looking at the valleys in the chart.
 
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                The pie chart on the top right shows how well your patrols were being executed, in terms of how many locations each patrol group has checked. For example, the green
                                 slice represents the fraction of patrols that checked 18+ out of all 20 locations. Naturally, we would want the green slice to be the largest, which would indicate that
                                  our patrols are usually checking most of the facility's locations.
 
                             </p>

                             <p>
                                If we click on the pie chart, we get an even more in-depth analysis of our patrol routes. The scatter plot shows information about our patrols' durations and
                                 number of logged checkpoints. The red point on the graph represents the average patrol route (average logged checkpoints and average patrol duration).
